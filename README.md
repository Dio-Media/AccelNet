# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# AccelNet

# AccelNet
-Stack Website Development Proposal: AccelNet
Prepared For: AccelNet Collaborative Members Date: September 22, 2025
1. Executive Summary
This proposal outlines the plan to design, develop, and deploy a full-stack web application named AccelNet. The platform's purpose is to serve as a dynamic, centralized hub for the six collaborating members: Brain Center, Carata, UCSF, UCL, NeuroLife, EBrains, and the Swiss Center for Effective Science. The project aims to solve the challenge of disparate information and a lack of real-time collaboration by creating a dynamic website that seamlessly manages and presents data, provides a clear communication channel, and showcases the collective work and expertise of its members.
2. Project Goals and Objectives
Primary Goal: To create an informative, resourceful, and collaborative online platform for the AccelNet consortium, facilitating research, communication, and knowledge sharing in the fields of Movement, Music, and Brain Health.
Key Objectives:
Build a dynamic and fully authenticated web platform with distinct access levels for academics, the public, corporations, and government entities.
Develop a secure and intelligent database to store, manage, and prevent duplicate entries for all content.
Implement features for dynamic content management and display of staff, students, resources, products (publications, news), objects, datasets, tools, and algorithms.
Create a user-friendly calendar to present upcoming events.
Integrate a comment system with automated filtering for inappropriate language.
Enable advanced filtering and search capabilities across all content types.
Implement a recommendation engine to suggest relevant content to users.
Integrate with the ORCID system to display relationships and facilitate professional connections.
3. Scope of Work
Included in this Proposal:
Front-End Development: Creation of all user-facing pages and interactive components. This includes a dynamic dashboard, a calendar view, content detail pages, and a responsive design for mobile and desktop.
Back-End Development: Development of the server-side logic and RESTful APIs to handle all dynamic content, user authentication, data integrity checks (for preventing duplicates), and filtering requests.
Database Management: Designing a robust database schema to handle diverse data types (staff, resources, etc.) and implementing the logic to prevent duplicate data entry.
Authentication & Authorization: Setting up a secure login system that manages different roles (academics, public, etc.) and controls access to specific content.
User Interaction Features: Implementing the comments section with a real-time profanity filter and the recommendation engine.
Data Handling & Integration: Developing the functionality to read data from provided websites and update content automatically. Integration with the ORCID API for relationship mapping.
Deployment: Setting up and deploying the application to a scalable cloud hosting service to ensure reliability and performance.
Testing: Comprehensive unit, integration, and user acceptance testing to ensure all features function as designed.
4. Technology Stack
A full-stack application requires both front-end and back-end technologies. The following stack is proposed to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability for a complex, data-driven platform like AccelNet.
Front-End:
Framework/Library: React
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Language: JavaScript
Back-End:
Language/Runtime: Node.js
Framework: Express.js
Database:
Type: MySQL
