# AccelNet
-Stack Website Development Proposal: AccelNet
Prepared For: AccelNet Collaborative Members Date: September 22, 2025
1. Executive Summary
This proposal outlines the plan to design, develop, and deploy a full-stack web application named AccelNet. The platform's purpose is to serve as a dynamic, centralized hub for the six collaborating members: Brain Center, Carata, UCSF, UCL, NeuroLife, EBrains, and the Swiss Center for Effective Science. The project aims to solve the challenge of disparate information and a lack of real-time collaboration by creating a dynamic website that seamlessly manages and presents data, provides a clear communication channel, and showcases the collective work and expertise of its members.
2. Project Goals and Objectives
Primary Goal: To create an informative, resourceful, and collaborative online platform for the AccelNet consortium, facilitating research, communication, and knowledge sharing in the fields of Movement, Music, and Brain Health.
Key Objectives:
Build a dynamic and fully authenticated web platform with distinct access levels for academics, the public, corporations, and government entities.
Develop a secure and intelligent database to store, manage, and prevent duplicate entries for all content.
Implement features for dynamic content management and display of staff, students, resources, products (publications, news), objects, datasets, tools, and algorithms.
Create a user-friendly calendar to present upcoming events.
Integrate a comment system with automated filtering for inappropriate language.
Enable advanced filtering and search capabilities across all content types.
Implement a recommendation engine to suggest relevant content to users.
Integrate with the ORCID system to display relationships and facilitate professional connections.
3. Scope of Work
Included in this Proposal:
Front-End Development: Creation of all user-facing pages and interactive components. This includes a dynamic dashboard, a calendar view, content detail pages, and a responsive design for mobile and desktop.
Back-End Development: Development of the server-side logic and RESTful APIs to handle all dynamic content, user authentication, data integrity checks (for preventing duplicates), and filtering requests.
Database Management: Designing a robust database schema to handle diverse data types (staff, resources, etc.) and implementing the logic to prevent duplicate data entry.
Authentication & Authorization: Setting up a secure login system that manages different roles (academics, public, etc.) and controls access to specific content.
User Interaction Features: Implementing the comments section with a real-time profanity filter and the recommendation engine.
Data Handling & Integration: Developing the functionality to read data from provided websites and update content automatically. Integration with the ORCID API for relationship mapping.
Deployment: Setting up and deploying the application to a scalable cloud hosting service to ensure reliability and performance.
Testing: Comprehensive unit, integration, and user acceptance testing to ensure all features function as designed.
4. Technology Stack
